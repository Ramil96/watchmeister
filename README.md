## Introduction
Welcome to Watchmeister, my Milestone Project 4 for the level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Application Development! <br>
This project will demonstrate my full-stack web development skills by creating a fully functional ecommerce web application. <br>

## UX/UI
### User Stories

**New Visitor**
- As a first-time visitor, I want to explore the available watches without having to create an account, so i can decide if I'm interested in what's being offered on the website.

- As a first-time visitor, I want to see the detailed information about each watch essentially seeing a description of the product.

- As a first-time visitor, I want to have the ability to register using my email, so I can access the other features of the website.

**As a Returning User**
- As a returning user, I want to log in quickly to my account and be able to see my saved inforation.

- As a returning user, I want to see the items I left in the bag from my last session so I can easily pick off from where I last was.

- As a returning user, I want to view my previously purchased items incase I want to buy another.

**As an Admin**

- As an admin, I want to add, update or remove products from my store.

- As an admin, I want to view and manage user accounts, so I can ensure a smooth user experience.

### Colour Scheme
![watchmeister-coolers](media/colorpallete.png)
For the Watchmeister web application, I've selected a streamlined basic colour scheme to ensure both style and readability, simplicity and adamant.

### Typography

I've selected Playfair Display and serif for my two fonts to ensure the feel of the website is luxury and elegance.

**[Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display)** adds elegance to website.

**[Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif)** provides readability for the main text

### Wireframes

#### Home Page

## UML Use Case Diagram

I have created the ULM Case Diagram to depict how different types of users and administrators interact with the system.

![watchmeister-ulm-use-case](media/uml.png)

## Database 
For development, I have used the SqLite3 database, as it is the default option for Django projects and is straightforward to set up in a development environment. When the site moves to Heroku, I will switch to PostgreSQL.

### Entitiy-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for this project provides a clear representation of the database structure. It shows how key entities such as users, roles, profiles, products, orders, are related to each other.

![watchmeister-erd](media/erd.png)


## Models Overview

### 1. User and Profile

**AuthUser**: Represents the users of the store with fields for authentication (username, password, email)
7:53
### 2. Orders
 - **CheckoutOrder**: Captures order details, including customer information (name, email), order totals, and selected delivery method. Each user can place multiple orders (One-to-Many relationship).
 - **CheckoutOrderitem**: Represents individual items within an order, including product details and quantity. Each order can contain several order items (One-to-Many relationship).
### 3. Products
 - **ProductsWatchmeister**: Defines the products available for purchase, with attributes such as SKU, name, description, and price. Each product can be linked to multiple order items (Many-to-One relationship).
### 4. VAT model (custom model)
 - **VAT**: Defines the use of VAT as a custom model.
### 5. FEEDBACK (custom model)
 - **FEEDBACK**: Defines the use of feedback form as a custom model.

## Testing
The apps functionalty was also tested by friends and family. Their feedback was invaluable in identifying any issues and making necessary improvements.

## Deployment
- **App Deployment:** The Henna Store app was deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform that facilitates easy and scalable application hosting. For more information about Heroku, click [here](https://www.heroku.com/).

- **Database Deployment:** The PostgreSQL database is used for data management, provided by Code Institute for students. More information about PostgreSQL can be found [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).

- **Static Files Deployment:** The app utilises Amazon S3 for hosting static files, ensuring efficient file storage and delivery. Learn more about S3 [here](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

- **Stripe Payments Integration:** The app incorporates Stripe for secure payment processing, including payment hooks and setup. Find out more about Stripe [here](https://stripe.com/docs).
